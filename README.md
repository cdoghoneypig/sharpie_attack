# sharpie_attack
Simple Python/PIL script to make semi-transparent black &amp; alpha overlays out of jpgs

As is, the script takes all jpgs in the folder "sharpie," increases brightness and contrast, then asks for brightness threshold
(above which to simply make blank pixels), and outputs a same-size image that can have color added below it 
(eg with background color for web or digital coloring with photoshop etc).
